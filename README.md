# neural-networks

Purpose of this neural network was to test if I understood the concept and inner workings of neural networks in general to be able to
hard code a network that could identify digits from the MNIST database. The neural network is able to identify 28x28 grayscale images
with over 90% accuracy. Everything is self taught from resources such as YouTube, Udemy, and friends with more experience in the field
of machine learning.
